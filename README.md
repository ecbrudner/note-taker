## Description
I created this app so the user can easily write and save notes. The process of developing this web app allowed me to practice using Express.js, creating HTML and API routes.
While the upfront work of writing the backend code was straightforward, I ended up having to do pretty extensive debugging to get the saved notes to display on the page and to display the existing notes upon clicking.

## Usage

User will first land on a landing page and click the "Get Started" button. They will then be taken to the notes page, where they can enter the Note Title and Note Text. Once they have entered the note title, they will see the option appear to "Clear Form" which they can use if they would like to clear their input. Once they have entered both the title and the text, they will see a "Save Note" button appear. Once they click the Save Note button, their note will be saved and displayed on the left side of the screen. When they click on an existing note on the side of the screen, they note will reopen.
